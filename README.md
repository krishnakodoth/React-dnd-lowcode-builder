# React-dnd-lowcode-builder
A simple low-code builder built with React and React DnD. This project demonstrates how to drag and drop pre-defined UI components (like inputs, checkboxes, and buttons) onto a canvas and render them dynamically â€” a foundational feature of modern low-code/no-code platforms.
